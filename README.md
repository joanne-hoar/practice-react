# MODULE 2 Practice Activities

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Activity #1

### Create a new react app from scratch

For example, use vite. Note that create-react-app is deprecated (see https://react.dev/blog/2025/02/14/sunsetting-create-react-app).

```bash
npm create vite@latest practice-react

cd practice-react

npm install
npm run dev
```

### Install vite cli 

```bash
npm install -D vite
```

## Run vite commands

```bash
npx vite dev
```
